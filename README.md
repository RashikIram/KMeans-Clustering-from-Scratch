# KMeans-Clustering-from-Scratch
From-scratch implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm applied to 2D data visualization and image compression through color quantization.


This project explores the K-Means clustering algorithm, a foundational technique in unsupervised machine learning. The algorithm is implemented entirely from scratch, without the use of external ML libraries, and applied to two main tasks. First, we use a 2D synthetic dataset to visualize how K-Means partitions data into clusters and analyze how the number of clusters affects distortion cost. Then, we apply K-Means to image compression by clustering similar colors and replacing each pixel with its cluster centroid, effectively reducing the color space while preserving visual quality. This project highlights both the theoretical understanding and practical utility of K-Means in data science workflows.
